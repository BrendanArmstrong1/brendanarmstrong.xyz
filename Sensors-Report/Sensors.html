                <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
                <h2 id="overviewbackground">Overview/Background</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this project was to create a bio metric sensor node that could be worn. The
                    information
                    collected from
                    the sensor node would then be transmitted via Bluetooth to a phone app such that the wearer could
                    then
                    read
                    the
                    data.</p>
                <p>The sensor node would be comprised of a temperature sensor, a perspiration sensor, and a blood
                    pressure
                    sensor. These
                    metrics would allow for the inference of health abnormalities and alert the user prior to
                    experiencing
                    physical
                    symptoms.</p>
                <p>The circumstances at the time of this project made it difficult to carry the teams dream to fruition.
                    Throughout the
                    second half of the semester, we had major setbacks and time delays and as a result, only a
                    preliminary
                    set
                    of
                    sensors was fabricated and used to read data while tethered to the computer. The Data was then
                    processed,
                    the
                    sensors were calibrated, and only the perspiration and temperature sensors were fully integrated
                    into
                    one
                    system. In
                    a cruel stroke of fate, these delays were caused by the very source of our motivation, the pandemic
                    of
                    2020.
                </p>
                <h2 id="motivessignificance">Motives/Significance</h2>
                <p>Many projects take their motivation from the state of the environment in which they were performed.
                    This
                    project is
                    much the same, only at the time this project was being formulated, a world-wide pandemic was
                    dominating
                    our
                    lives.
                    COVID-19 is a terrifying virus not just because of its efficacy, but because itâs asymptomatic
                    transmission.
                    The
                    host of the virus does not even know they are infected and will spread the disease for days before
                    they
                    present
                    physical symptoms, if they develop symptoms at all.</p>
                <p>It is for this reason that our group has decided on measuring health parameters so that we may detect
                    early
                    symptoms
                    of illnesses that would have otherwise been unnoticed. Another use of these wearable sensors would
                    be
                    fitness
                    monitoring, we could have stored the wearers data in the phone app and processed it to score general
                    fitness
                    and
                    activity levels. This would be similar to currently available devices like the fitbit.</p>
                <h2 id="design-objectives">Design Objectives</h2>
                <p>The sensor node needed to be able to be worn around the users arm. This would be done with a flexible
                    material. This
                    means that it needed to be comfortable and have the potential to be stylish. There would need to be
                    an
                    on-board
                    power supply as well as a processing and transmission module to send data to the phone app. The
                    phone
                    app
                    would need
                    the ability to display information, and since our original idea was to process the data using the
                    phones
                    processor,
                    that is where all of out back end capabilities would come into play. Should the user show signs of
                    health
                    degradation, the phone app should alert the user.</p>
                <h2 id="design-specifications">Design Specifications</h2>
                <p>We had decided that the flexible material which would contain the wearable circuitry would be kapton,
                    a
                    polyimide
                    film that can remain stable at temperatures from <span class="math inline">âââ269</span> up to <span
                        class="math inline">400</span> . This temperature range is suitable because our target range is
                    between
                    20-40 .
                    The perspiration sensor was supposed to sense moister from sweat generated by the user. We opted for
                    a
                    capacitive
                    sensor with interdigitated electrodes. The blood pressure sensor needed to sense small changes in
                    pressure
                    caused by
                    the pulse of the users artery. In order to achieve this, we had decided on PVDF, a piezoelectric
                    polymer
                    which
                    generates voltage when the structure is deformed.</p>
                <p>The thermal sensor was decided to be a positive temperature coefficient thermistor and will be
                    discussed
                    at
                    great
                    length in this report.</p>

                    that I needed and came in use when I was designing the differential amplifier for signal processing,
                    shown
                    in fig <a href="#fig:ConditioningCircuit" data-reference-type="ref"
                        data-reference="fig:ConditioningCircuit">8</a>. One of
                    the largest problem that I had was trying to filter the signal output of my initial circuit in fig
                    <a href="#fig:InitialCuircuit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:InitialCuircuit">5</a>.
                    I
                    will
                    discuss
                    the challenges I had with the conditioning circuit in later sections. Other resources include the
                    journal
                    articles
                    which our professor sent. I used two of the journal articles, the 2018 article <span
                        class="citation" data-cites="Sensors2018"></span> which goes over a four in one sensor module
                    for the purposes of
                    monitoring
                    proton exchange in fuel cells. And the 2016 article <span class="citation"
                        data-cites="Nature2016"></span>
                    which
                    takes an in depth look at in situ perspiration analysis. In order to get the values for the metals
                    to
                    use in
                    fabrication of the sensors I used the engineers toolbox website <span class="citation"
                        data-cites="Etool"></span>.
                </p>
                <p>In order to get the prefabricated microprocessor to work I used documentation from Adafruit <span
                        class="citation" data-cites="ADA"></span> to get it to work with the arduino integrated
                    development
                    environment. I also spent a
                    great deal of time trying to find a way to extract the data from the serial readout of the FLORA.
                    This
                    is
                    where the
                    free software that I found comes into play. CoolTerm is is software that I got from <span
                        class="citation" data-cites="CoolTerm"></span>, it was made by a man named Roger Meier who is an
                    electrical engineer
                    operating
                    out of Florida. CoolTerm watches serial ports on your PC and duplicates it and gives you the option
                    to
                    print
                    the
                    output to a txt file.</p>

                <p>Engineer is a protected term meaning that you cannot claim to be an engineer without a license.
                    Falsely
                    claiming you
                    are an engineer could be a fine up to $25,000 as it is a protected title. The purpose of
                    professional
                    engineering is
                    to preserve the safeguarding of life, health, property, economic interest, the public welfare or the
                    environment. An
                    organization must have at least one professional engineer who will take responsibility for
                    engineering
                    and
                    be
                    insured against professional liability. A regulated professions primary purpose is quality
                    assurance.
                    The
                    licensing
                    first started in 1896 to ensure the professional safety of engineering. There are twelve engineering
                    regulators
                    across Canada. The purpose of engineers Canada is to serve the regulators, promote and maintain the
                    interests,
                    honor, and integrity of engineering in Canada. There are ten tenants to govern the regulators;</p>

                <h3 id="professional-certification-requirements">Professional certification requirements</h3>
                <p>The accreditation board was established in 1965 and accredits engineering programs that meet the
                    requirements. The
                    qualifications board promotes mobility, consistent practices and shared programs. They also help
                    international
                    engineers who want to work in Canada.</p>
                <p>Licensure is the mark of a professional. Any act of designing, composing, evaluation, advising,
                    reporting,
                    directing,
                    or supervising where life, health, property, or public welfare is concerned that requires the
                    application of
                    engineering principles requires a license. Many graduates believe that graduating allows them to
                    call
                    themselves
                    engineer. However the license is what determines if you are an engineer. There are five categories
                    for
                    getting a
                    license;</p>

                    acceptable
                    engineering education or a practical examination. You must have good character and references from a

                    of one
                    professional engineer. You must take a professional practice examination which is about 3 hours
                    long.
                    Ethics
                    is
                    important as engineers are professional representatives for all engineers.</p>
                <p>Professional engineers Ontario (PEO) is a regulatory body that governs engineering in Ontario where
                    there
                    are
                    over
                    80,000 engineers. The head office is in Toronto at young and Shepard. PEO is self-regulating and
                    sets
                    standards for
                    Ontario. Formed in 1922, before this, engineers did not practice to a set standard and instead
                    engineered to
                    their
                    own standards. The regulation of PEO happens through three steps, admissions, enforcement, and
                    discipline.
                    They have
                    the power to give licenses and take them away. Similar associations are found in other provinces
                    however
                    PEO
                    is the
                    regulatory body in Ontario. There are about 190,000 engineers in Canada. Engineers Canada is the
                    umbrella
                    organization for the national standards. Those who are licensed in one province are able to move to
                    other
                    provinces.
                </p>
                <p>There are two basic types of law, statutory law created by legislative bodies, and common law,
                    created
                    from
                    precedent. An Act is the primary law governing some issue of public interest. The professional
                    engineers
                    act
                    creates
                    a controlled activity of professional engineering; it establishes PEO as the authority. Regulations
                    are
                    the
                    secondary level of laws. Power to make regulations is delegated to the ministries that govern the
                    areas
                    of
                    interest.
                    PEO has the power to grant licenses. There are two regulations under the professional engineers act.
                    Regulation 941
                    and regulation 260/08, 941 govern elections and code of ethics. 260/08 governs professional
                    standards
                    and
                    inspections.</p>
                <h3 id="health-and-safety-at-work">Health and safety at work</h3>
                <p>Engineers are required to safeguard life, health, and property. Engineers have a duty to act with
                    fairness
                    and
                    loyalty, fidelity to public needs, and devotion to public good. OHSA talks about your rights and
                    responsibility of
                    workers and employers. The internal responsibility system talks about a joint health and safety
                    committee
                    and health
                    and safety representatives. The ministry of labour is the enforcement body for the health and safety
                    of
                    workplaces.
                    The ministry of labour inspectors do not need warrants to enter and inspect a workplace. Individuals
                    can
                    be
                    fined up
                    to $25,000 per charge and corporations can be fined up to $500,000 for each charge. The criminal
                    code
                    changed in
                    1992 due to an explosion at a mine where the officers on site could have reported it but did not.
                    Bill
                    C-45
                    states
                    that any officer is under the legal duty to take reasonable steps to prevent harm arising to
                    workers.
                    Employers must
                    make sure they inform workers about dangers and how to avoid them. Constructors are responsible for
                    ensuring
                    the
                    safety for all employees on that project. Workers must obey safety procedures and report hazards to
                    the
                    higher-ups.
                </p>
                <p>Hazards can take two forms, acute and chronic. Acute hazards are immediate dangers. Chronic hazards
                    are
                    due
                    to long
                    lasting hazards. A third category of hazards is latent, where the effects appear much later after
                    the
                    hazard
                    has
                    happened. Illnesses are caused by exposure to a harmful substance. Inhalation, ingestion, skin
                    absorption or
                    injection is the primary means that harmful substances enter our body. All dangers that are present
                    in
                    the
                    workplace
                    must be considered and a strategy for preventing them created. Hazards can be controlled at the
                    source,
                    along the
                    path, and at the worker. If you cannot control the source of the hazard, you can control the hazard
                    along
                    the path
                    to the worker. If that is not possible then the hazard can be controlled at the worker but this is
                    not
                    recommended
                    because every worker is unique and variations will occur.</p>
                <p>Pre start health and safety review (PHSR) is in the design work of an engineer. There are many
                    aspects to
                    the
                    PHSR
                    for which a professional engineer is responsible. The PHSR must be completed prior to the workplace
                    functioning and
                    the report should be kept on site. Engineers are responsible for arranging the compliance of
                    apparatus,
                    structures
                    or protective elements.</p>

                <p>Ethics is an activity we engage in every time we ask the question âwhat should I doâ. Ethics is
                    concerned
                    with taking
                    actions that will create positive results in oneâs life or the lives of others. The four major
                    ethical
                    theories are;
                    Virtue based ethics, Rights based ethics, Duty based ethics, and consequence based ethics.</p>
                <p>Virtue based ethics was formed from Aristotle and means discerning and promoting the proper goals.
                    Paying
                    attention
                    to how things work and discerning their inner structure. A virtue is a cultivated habit, a formation
                    of
                    character.
                    The limitations of virtue based ethics involve the reliance on strangers following rules and not
                    character
                    evaluations.</p>
                <p>Rights based ethics of John Locke revolves around the rejection of authority. The goal is to allow
                    all
                    persons full
                    liberty and full participation in society. When living in society we use reason to establish social
                    contracts to
                    direct how we live. Rights based ethics divides rights into public and private spheres. Public
                    spheres
                    are
                    enforced
                    by courts of law. The private realm establishes individual rights for private affairs like belief
                    system.
                </p>
                <p>Duty based ethics of Immanuel Kant was established around the obligations of individual in a society.
                    Personal
                    conviction and rational autonomy are the primary focuses of duty based ethics. One should act in
                    accordance
                    to
                    principles that must be applicable to all persons, not just ourselves, act onto others as you want
                    others to
                    act to
                    you. The limitations of duty based ethics are conflicting obligations and overemphasis on the law.
                </p>
                <p>Consequence based ethics or Utilitarian ethics was created by John Stuart Mill. It was created
                    because a
                    standard was
                    necessary to compare ethics. Humans naturally pursue their own happiness. Sometimes what is good for
                    an
                    individual
                    isnât good for the group, Utilitarian ethics judges actions based on the overall good it
                    accomplishes.
                </p>
                <p>No one model is sufficient, a combination of these ethical models is necessary. When deliberation is
                    performed an
                    activity in ethical dynamics is taking place to discover the best course of action. The framework
                    for
                    ethical
                    deliberation is aims at understanding the overall goal of ethics. The diagnostic loop is an
                    effective
                    tool
                    for
                    ethical deliberation, exploring the situation, verifying it, deciding on what to do then paying
                    attention to
                    the
                    results.</p>
                <p>Regulation 941 governs the ethics of engineering in Ontario. The core ethics of engineering consists
                    of
                    three
                    categories, Professional misconduct, Code of ethics, and whistleblowing.</p>
                <p>Professional misconduct is being convicted of an offence that relates to the practice of professional
                    engineering.
                    Acting in a negligent manner includes positive actions and omissions.</p>
                <p>Negligence can be divided into three elements. A failure to act when it will impact another person or
                    the
                    public, not
                    fulfilling standards or causing property damage are all elements of negligence.</p>
                <p>Commissions is performing work which you are not licensed to do. Omissions are not making reasonable
                    provisions
                    during the course of your work. The punishments for violating professional misconduct range from
                    revocation
                    of the
                    license and suspension to fining. Publishing the details of the violation publicly is also a
                    possibility
                    and
                    this is
                    particularly damaging.</p>
                <p>The five primary categories are the obligations to;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Public</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Clients</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Profession</p>
                    </li>

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Obligations to the client include conflicts of interest. If you have a bias to a project that will
                    affect
                    the
                    outcome, this must be disclosed. Obligations to professionals includes enhancing the public regard
                    for
                    professional
                    engineering. You must discourage actions that will diminish the publicâs image of engineers. You
                    have an
                    obligation
                    to cooperate with other professionals. Giving proper credit or compensation for others work is in
                    the
                    obligation to
                    other professionals. You must act faithfully to your client as an agent and trustee of information.
                    Obligations to
                    everyone include having high ideals of honor and integrity.</p>
                <p>Failure to make reasonable provisions for the safeguarding of life, health, or property of a person
                    or
                    public
                    is a
                    violation of the code of ethics. You owe fairness and loyalty to your client, however if the clients
                    actions
                    violate
                    the code of ethics you have the option for whistleblowing. This option will severely effect your
                    future
                    as
                    you will
                    be known as a whistleblower.</p>
                <h2 id="impact-of-engineering-on-society">Impact of Engineering on Society</h2>
                <p>Engineeringâs impact on society can be easily seen in just the past 100 years, power grids and cell
                    phones
                    are just
                    part of the importance. The first duty of the engineer is public safety. Some of the earliest
                    engineers
                    were
                    the
                    ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian engineers who built pyramids. The only tools at their disposal
                    were
                    primitive, and
                    the mathematical tools we have like the Pythagorean Theorem were not yet invented. Greek engineers
                    were
                    known as
                    architekton, a master of the practical arts. Roman engineers were masters of project management.
                    They
                    built
                    the
                    famous aqueducts, the pantheon, and the colosseum. Leonardo da Vinci was a multi-talented engineer
                    in
                    the
                    Italian
                    renaissance who predicted the helicopter and tank. Early engineers made huge impacts on everyday
                    life
                    and
                    will
                    continue to do so in the future.</p>
                <p>Regarding sustainable designs, Safety measures, and economic implications, in this section, the role
                    that
                    engineers
                    play in society and the responsibilities associated with the position will be discussed.</p>
                <h3 id="place-of-engineering-in-society">Place of engineering in society</h3>
                <p>The Canadian parliament passed an act in 1887, to include civil engineers into the engineering
                    profession.
                    This was
                    the start of the professional engineering in Canada. Since then, many Canadian engineers have done
                    great
                    work. Elsie
                    MacGill was the first Canadian Woman to earn a degree in Electrical engineering in 1927. She was the
                    first
                    woman in
                    North America to earn a degree in aeronautical engineering. Canada has had some terrible failures
                    unfortunately. The
                    Quebec Bridge collapsed twice killing many people. The first meal cooked with electricity in the
                    world
                    was
                    cooked in
                    Ottawa.</p>
                <p>Engineering in our society requires people who are diligent enough to take even small factors into
                    consideration. For
                    example, the Tacoma narrows bridge was negligently designed such that the oscillations produced from
                    the
                    wind
                    rolling past it excited the bridges resonant frequency. This led the famous collapse, not only
                    causing
                    massive
                    economic damage, but also damage to the engineers reputation.</p>
                <h3 id="sustainable-design-life-cycle-planning">Sustainable design; life-cycle planning</h3>
                <p>Engineers are bound to a code of ethics which extends to the environment. Engineers take a cradle to
                    grave
                    approach
                    when designing to analyze the full life cycle of a product. Environment Canada monitors the
                    environment.
                    The
                    Canadian environmental protection act (CEPA) was created in 1999. The act prevents pollution and
                    elimination
                    of bio
                    accumulative toxins. Waste must be disposed of properly because it could affect the environment.
                    Owners
                    of
                    substances are strictly liable for restoration or reparation of public sites where damage has been
                    caused.
                </p>
                <p>Sustainability must be quantifiable. Greenwashing is marketing products as sustainable when they
                    arenât
                    really
                    sustainable. Bottled water is about 2000 times more energy expensive than tap water, making it not
                    very
                    green.
                    Sustainability concerns the actions taken by present persons that will not impact future persons.
                    Economic
                    sustainability allows for future persons to have wealth. Social sustainability is the least well
                    defined
                    but
                    consists of 5 parts;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Quality of Life</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Equity</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Diversity</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Social Cohesion</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Democracy</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Environmental impact is equal to the product of the population, affluence, and technology. The
                    ecological
                    footprint
                    is the fraction of resources allocated to a population. The current carrying capacity of earth is
                    about
                    3-13
                    billion.</p>
                <p>The first challenge in sustainability is limited temporal scope. We donât have a far enough view into
                    the
                    future to
                    recognize costs. A limited spatial scope is a problem as well, as we donât look at what happens far
                    enough
                    around
                    us. People often donât think far beyond themselves which makes it hard to improve sustainability. An
                    example
                    of this
                    is the protesting of green power turbines near them. The tragedy of the commons is a problem which
                    states
                    that other
                    people will exploit resources so if you donât exploit them, you will lose. Jevons paradox states
                    that if
                    you
                    make a
                    product more sustainable, people will just use it more. We cannot modify human behavior directly,
                    but if
                    we
                    make the
                    path that humans take the most efficient ones, then we can get ahead.</p>
                <p>Quantifying sustainability is important to improving it. Assign value to externalities in the process
                    of
                    creation.
                    Assess the impact of a products life cycle. And keep in mind the material flow in the process.
                    Looking
                    at
                    the whole
                    life cycle of a project will reveal the true costs that will be incurred. Putting sustainability
                    into
                    practice
                    involves modifying technology. We can make the world better by using more efficient materials, less
                    energy,
                    and
                    overall make technology better for the world. Sustainability can improve by designing products to
                    last
                    longer.
                    Bio-mimicry is a useful strategy for sustainability by imitating nature.</p>

                <p>The industrial revolution and mechanical engineering started in Great Britain and spread rapidly.
                    James
                    Watt
                    created
                    the steam engine in 1765 and brought forth the ability to get power without relying on falling
                    water. He
                    created
                    this engine in order to pump water out of a coal mine to extract more coal. In the 19th century,
                    electrical
                    engineering bloomed with scientists like Ohm, Faraday, Maxwell, and Siemens. There was a battle
                    between
                    Edison and
                    Tesla for using DC current and AC current respectively. Edison was particularly petty, He even

                <p>Not only do engineers need to design things to work, but they also need to design things to work when
                    the
                    most
                    "creative" people are using the things. Designing solutions to problems must take society into
                    account.

                <p>Engineering can have an impact on environmental issues as well as health and safety issues. It is
                    because
                    of
                    this
                    that government regulations have come in to set standards.</p>
                <p>Within the province of Ontario there are environmental statues that protect the environment like the
                    green
                    energy
                    act. The Ontario environmental protection act (EPA) is the primary regulation in Ontario. The basic
                    intent
                    is to
                    prohibit the emissions of negative environmental substances. Approval from the EPA is required for
                    any
                    discharge
                    from stacks, wastewater or waste deposits on land. There is a requirement for the best available
                    economically viable
                    technology. Ontario also has a secondary tier of approvals called the environmental activity and
                    sector
                    registry
                    (EASR). It is intended to govern the lower risk activities including heating systems and power
                    systems.
                    The
                    EASR
                    required a registration of low risk activities, and getting approval or permit for renewable energy
                    generation.</p>
                <p>The EPA has regulations around spills and contamination. In the event of a spill or contamination,
                    you
                    are
                    obligated
                    to notify the spill action center. You are required to do everything practicable to clean up spills.
                    Maximum
                    fines
                    for corporations are up to 10 million and individuals can be imprisoned for up to 5 years.</p>
                <p>The green energy act was enacted to encourage new green energy technology development. Ontario has
                    programs
                    where
                    costs can be partially reimbursed to companies that install renewable energy. Only British Columbia
                    and
                    Quebec have
                    carbon taxes based on how much energy is used. Purchasers of companies acquire all assets and
                    liabilities
                    including
                    past environmental issues.</p>
                <h2 id="economics-project-management">Economics &amp; Project Management</h2>
                <p>For engineering projects to be successful, a manager must allocate resources where they are the most
                    effective. In
                    this section, I will be talking about the time value of money, depreciation, amortization, and
                    taxes. As
                    well I will
                    be talking about risk and time management.</p>
                <h3 id="engineering-economics">Engineering economics</h3>
                <p>Effective resource management is crucial for any project to be successful. The first step to
                    realizing
                    how to
                    allocate resources effectively is to understand the time value of money. Money itself depreciates
                    with
                    value
                    every
                    day it is held as FIAT currency, so a good way to grow money is to trade money today for something
                    that
                    will
                    grow
                    with value over time. This is why money is thought to have a "time value". For example, the âS&amp;P
                    500â(SPY) has
                    historically had a growth of 7%-8% per year growth, when compared to historical inflation at
                    approximately
                    2% this
                    means shares of SPY grow in value at a rate of 5%-6% per year. This means that money is made simply
                    by
                    owning an
                    item of value. an engineering project can be thought of in the same way but with more growth and
                    decay
                    parameters.
                </p>
                <p>There are other factors which cause resources to experience the same fluctuations in value. Taxes are
                    a
                    source of a
                    lot of creativity when it comes to financial engineering. When a project successfully generates
                    revenue,
                    that money
                    is taxes by the government. In order make more money, some of these taxes will need to be avoided.
                    This
                    can
                    be done
                    through amortization of assets, which is the process of paying off a large purchase over many tax
                    intervals.
                    Doing
                    this, the value of the payments can be deducted from taxable income and more resources can be used
                    for
                    the
                    project.
                </p>
                <p>Money can also be harvested from the expensive equipment at the end of their life for a salvage
                    value. In
                    addition to
                    the value of assets, a good manager also considers the value of the team at their disposal. This is
                    where
                    risk and
                    change management comes into play</p>
                <h3 id="risk-and-change-management">Risk and change management</h3>
                <p>In engineering challenges, there are risks and there are fixed parameters. Fixed parameters are
                    things
                    like
                    prices,
                    interest rates, and cash flows. Risk comes with uncertain outcomes. In order to properly assess the
                    risk
                    of
                    a
                    project, a sensitivity analysis will need to be preformed. The first step is to make a break even
                    analysis,
                    which is
                    used to assess the effect of changes in project parameters one at a time. A good manager will also
                    understand the
                    probabilities of events happening and how to account for them in an economic analysis. These factors
                    will
                    then be
                    used to make a decision tree.</p>
                <p>The break even analysis is the process of varying one parameter of the project at a time to find the
                    break
                    even
                    point, the point at which cost equals revenue. When preforming break even analysis, one must
                    consider
                    how
                    many
                    projects are available and if they are mutually exclusive, the best choice for which projects to
                    pursue
                    will
                    be a
                    combination of interest rate, revenue, and initial investment.</p>
                <p>Obtaining the appropriate probabilities of events happening, and how to apply them to management
                    decisions. A
                    probability is found either through historical data for educated inference and can be applied as a
                    weight to
                    the
                    outcome with which it is associated. After all outcomes and probabilities have been calculated, a
                    decision
                    tree can
                    finally be made.</p>
                <p>There are four components of a decision tree;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>A decision node represents a decision to be made.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A chance node represents an event whose outcome is uncertain.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The branches connect nodes from left to right.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The leaves indicate the values, or payoffs.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>In this case, the leaves are at the end of the tree and typically the largest leaf is selected. This
                    leaf
                    is
                    selected
                    even if there is risk associated with it because the risk is factored in with the weight of the
                    probability.

                        <p>Different members of our group had different time schedules due to taking on multiple
                            responsibilities for
                            the duration of the project. But we made sure to meet twice a week. once with the professor
                            and
                            once
                            on
                            Saturday at 11:00am. Our meeting with the professor was Thursday for the first semester and
                            moved to
                            Wednesday for the second semester. Occasionally when deadlines were approaching, our group
                            would
                            hold a
                            second meeting after the meeting with the professor in addition to the meeting on Saturday.
                            Asynchronous
                            communication was also heavily utilized by the group though our MS teams chat.</p>
                        <p>As for my own personal schedule. The first semester was heavy for me in terms of class work.
                            I
                            was
                            taking 4
                            other classes in addition to project so my work would fit whatever time i gave it. But the
                            second
                            semester
                            was completely free for me. Project was the only obligation I had aside from my part time
                            job as
                            an
                            emergency superintendent in my building, which rarely required my attention. I contribute my
                            success
                            in
                            troubleshooting problems to this freedom. Since this was a remote project, I was mostly
                            required
                            to
                            solve
                            problems with testing or equipment on my own. Although I received some help whenever I
                            really
                            needed
                            it, it
                            was difficult to email people for advice on trivial things. Since I had all the extra time,
                            this
                            was
                            how i
                            spent it. Eventually I sent the equipment to Thomas who then started to do his own testing.
                            I
                            was
                            then able
                            to focus on processing my data.</p>

                        <p>With the entire semester being online only, the group had an unusual dynamic. We established
                            our
                            roles early
                            on in the project and kept in constant contact through MS teams. Through our shared
                            displeasure
                            at
                            the
                            situation we were able to come together and solve problems. When the testing equipment and
                            older
                            IDEâs were
                            delivered to our possession, there were days when we spent hours on voice/video chat trying
                            to
                            trouble shoot
                            how we could read the old sensors. Not having any physical interaction with any of our
                            members
                            was
                            weird for
                            group cohesion. One was in charge of the conditioning circuit, but seemed distant and would
                            only
                            respond to the group when he was directly inquired. This led to me ultimately having to
                            create
                            my
                            own low

                            Another
                            was
                            eager to
                            prove his worth but kept getting himself into situations, like moving to Saudi Arabia and
                            contracting COVID,
                            he even had a problem with his eye where he couldnât see for 2 weeks. One group member was
                            in
                            Ottawa
                            but his
                            role was
                            primarily software based so we didnât interact as a group often. A great deal of the MS
                            teams
                            private chat
                            is another member and myself trying to troubleshoot problems. I feel that a lot of group
                            members
                            were
                            worried about
                            the amount of work that they could potentially put into the project not being enough to
                            satisfy
                            requirements. This ended up as a great source of strain in moments of high tension. But
                            every
                            time
                            tensions
                            flared up, we sorted it out and ultimately came through with a positive mental attitude.</p>

                        <p>Leadership, initiative, and mentoring teammates</p>
                        <p>Since the beginning of the project, I wanted to move the meetings along the right path and
                            make
                            efficient use
                            of our time. It was for this reason that I eventually became de-facto leader of the project.
                            One
                            of
                            the
                            problems was that this wasnât officially established until later in the project. There were
                            times
                            when i
                            thought that group members should have been more active in the chat to give their input. But
                            without
                            a clear
                            designation of leadership I feared it would sow discontent if I voiced that opinion. There
                            were
                            multiple
                            moments where Tariq would come to me about project questions and concerns and I believe he
                            saw
                            me as
                            the
                            leader. Near the end of the project though, after the equipment was transferred, Thomas
                            ended up
                            taking on
                            more responsibility in testing and helping Tariq get readings from his pressure sensor.</p>

                <p>Now to refocus our sights on the primary topic of this report, the thermal sensor. My contribution to
                    the
                    project was
                    the design and testing of the thermal sensor and in this section I will be discussing what this
                    means.
                    First
                    I will
                    asses the design options available for thermal sensors and consider the economic, social,
                    environmental,
                    and
                    ethical
                    impacts that these options have. I will then discuss the choice of thermal sensor made and go into
                    detail
                    about
                    specific parameters of the design. After the final design has been revealed I will talk about the
                    challenges
                    of
                    trying to test sensors in my home laboratory and how I managed to overcome these challenges to
                    receive
                    precise
                    results.</p>
                <h2 id="alternative-design-assessment">Alternative Design &amp; Assessment</h2>
                <p>When considering Thermal sensors there are four types of sensors for consideration;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Thermocouple</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Semiconductor</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Negative Temperature Coefficient</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Positive Temperature Coefficient</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Each of these types of sensors has their advantages and disadvantages. When thinking about what type
                    of
                    thermal
                    sensor to choose it would be prudent to keep in mind the criteria that need to be met. As stated in
                    introduction,
                    this sensor is intended to be a bio metric sensor that will be worn against the body to provide
                    health
                    measurements
                    while being worn. The temperature sensor needs to measure temperatures accurately within the range
                    of 20
                    to
                    40. The
                    physical sensor itself must be flexible enough to survive being fabricated on Kapton and survive
                    though
                    out
                    its life
                    cycle. The sensor must also be comfortable to wear against the skin for extended periods of time.
                    The
                    life
                    cycle of
                    the sensor was never a point of consideration for this project as our group did not reach the point
                    of
                    prototyping
                    for consumption. Since this is the case it was assumed the life cycle would be the life of the user
                    at
                    approximately
                    80 to 100 years.</p>
                <p>A thermocouple is a device which has two dissimilar metals electrically bonded to each other. As the
                    two
                    metals
                    experience a temperature change, internal charge carriers migrate towards the metal with lower
                    internal
                    energy. This
                    causes a voltage to be generated across them. This technology is widely used as an inexpensive
                    method of
                    temperature
                    control and is versatile because it can also be used in reverse. If a voltage is passed through a
                    thermocouple it
                    can be arranged so that it will "pump" heat from one place to another, so it makes a good
                    temperature
                    control system
                    as well as a temperature detector. The disadvantages of thermocouples are that they would be
                    uncomfortable
                    for the
                    user to wear given their shape. this also needs a reference temperature that would remain stable,
                    which
                    is
                    difficult
                    to do because one of the temperatures would be body temperature and the reference would be
                    atmospheric
                    which
                    is
                    cyclic in nature and would not remain stable. The output of thermocouple is non linear in nature
                    which
                    would
                    mean
                    that more components would be necessary to process the signal.</p>
                <p>Semiconductor based thermal sensors exploit the thermal response of semiconductors. As a
                    semiconductor
                    junction heats
                    up, more charges are excited to the conduction band creating a temperature sensitive voltage vs
                    current
                    response.
                    these sensors typically have a linear output from -40 to 120. when manufactured en mass they are low
                    cost
                    and have
                    good accuracy. Though the durability of the semiconductor material would be questionable when trying
                    to
                    apply them
                    to a flexible material and read body temperature. The underlying material would be doped silicon or
                    a
                    similar
                    ceramic material, so with repeated stress applied from flexing the arm band the sensor may break.
                </p>
                <p>The next two categories of thermal sensors operate in the same fashion, they are the resistance
                    temperature
                    detector
                    (RTD) thermal sensor. They operate by exploiting the temperature dependant change in the electrical
                    resistive
                    properties of materials.</p>
                <p>The first class mentioned in the list above is the negative temperature coefficient thermistor. this
                    type
                    of
                    RTD
                    decreases its resistance in response to an increase in temperature. This type of sensor is made from
                    ceramics or
                    polymer materials. The polymer version of this sensor could be suitable for this project as it would
                    be
                    flexible
                    enough to survive use. However there is one fatal flaw with this type of sensor, the non-linearity
                    of
                    output
                    response. This means that a larger processing circuit will be required to make it operate. This also
                    means
                    that the
                    specialized polymer would be more expensive.</p>
                <p>The final class of thermal sensor is the positive temperature coefficient RTD. This sensor increases
                    in
                    electrical
                    resistance as the temperature of the material increases. This type of sensor is made of metals and
                    has
                    an
                    accurate
                    linear output within the range of -200 to 600. This temperature range is ultimately dependant on the
                    metal
                    chosen
                    and the substrate on which it rests. Since the sensor will be deposited on Kapton it will work for
                    temperatures up
                    to 400. The temperature characteristics may be overkill since they suitable to be used on the
                    surface of
                    Venus, but
                    other factors make this type of sensor more attractive than the others. Because these sensors are
                    made
                    from
                    cheaper
                    metals, the cost is low and made lower if they can be manufactured en mass. These sensors will be
                    made
                    with
                    metal
                    deposition so the thin metal will not only be comfortable, but it will be able to survive the
                    fatigue of
                    being
                    mounted on a flexible piece of active wear.</p>
                <p>From an economic standpoint, depositing metal on Kapton seems to be the best place to start since the
                    mask
                    could be
                    reused and the entire circuit could be printed on the polymer substrate. as for the environmental
                    implications,
                    Kapton as a polymer does end up in landfills along with other electronics frequently there is a
                    great
                    effort
                    to
                    develop new recycling techniques for this polyimide material. This technology does not change the
                    social
                    landscape
                    so there would be no effect there. And the worst ethical argument one could make towards this
                    technology
                    is
                    that of
                    environmental waste.</p>
                <p>With consideration of all of these arguments, the most effective thermal sensor for the purposes of
                    this
                    project is
                    the Positive temperature coefficient RTD. In the next section the specifics of the design with this
                    style of
                    thermal
                    sensor will be discussed.</p>
                <h2 id="chosen-design-details-verification">Chosen Design Details &amp; Verification</h2>
                <p>The Choice made was the positive temperature coefficient RTD thermistor, and the plan was to exploit
                    the
                    change in
                    electrical resistance of a material experiencing a temperature change. The first step was to
                    understand
                    how
                    to best
                    use this technique is to understand the rules governing the electrical resistance in materials.</p>
                <p>All materials have some electrical resistance property associated with them, for materials labelled
                    insulators, the
                    electriacal resistance is high, for conductors, it is low. The equation describing the electrical
                    resistance
                    of any
                    material is shown in \eqref{baseRes} eq .</p>
                <p>
                    \begin{equation}
                    R_o = \frac{L}{A}\rho
                    \label{baseRes}
                    \tag{1}
                    \end{equation}
                </p>
                <p>The base resistance (<span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>o</em></sub></span>) of some piece
                    of
                    material is a
                    function of the length of material that electricity must flow though (<span
                        class="math inline"><em>L</em></span>),
                    the cross sectional area of the material (<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>), and the
                    resistivity
                    of the
                    material (<span class="math inline"><em>Ï</em></span>). Resistivity is a material property and will
                    be
                    chosen when
                    material analysis is done.</p>
                <p>The equation that describes the change in electrical resistance with a change in temperature is shown
                    in
                    eq \eqref{ThermalRes}
                </p>
                <p>$$
                    \begin{equation}
                    R = R_o(1 + \alpha\Delta T)
                    \label{ThermalRes}
                    \tag{2}
                    \end{equation}
                    $$

                </p>
                <p>This says that the new resistance (<span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span>) is a function of the
                    base
                    resistance
                    (<span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>o</em></sub></span>), temperature change (<span
                        class="math inline"><em>Î</em><em>T</em></span>), and temperature coefficient (<span
                        class="math inline"><em>Î±</em></span>). In order to get the greatest change in resistance for a
                    small
                    temperature change, the base resistance from equation \eqref{baseRes} needs to be maximized. In
                    order to do this, the sensor
                    will
                    be
                    fabricated in a serpentine form as seen in figure <a href="#fig:serpentine"
                        data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:serpentine">1</a>. With this, the length can be
                    maximized and the cross
                    sectional

                <p>Now that the geometry of the sensor was planned, the material choice was the next consideration. The
                    material
                    that
                    the sensor was made of needed to produce the largest resistance change for the approximately 15
                    temperature
                    change.
                    The dimensions that were decided on were based on the limitations of the fabrication methods used in
                    the
                    lab. This
                    meant that the width of the serpentine wire as well as the gaps between wires was going to be <span

                    fragility
                    issues. Information on four of the most common metals used in thermal sensors was put together in
                    the
                    following
                    tables. the calculated values are for a sensor patch <span

                <p>Since the metric that was used for the best metal to choose was the overall change in resistance, the

                    metal to
                    choose is clearly chromium. Two sizes of thermal sensor were designed, one patch would be <span

                    first

                    March 5th.
                    The thermal sensors consisted of two clusters of four sensors. In total there were four small
                    sensors
                    which
                    were

                    is that

                    sensors
                    will
                    be

                <p>The Lab technicians were kind enough to wire bond gold wires to the contact pads on the sensors and
                    fix
                    them
                    to the
                    protoboard as shown in the figures of the sensors. Something to note for later discussion is the
                    size of
                    the
                    silicon
                    chip on which the small sensors are resting, compared to the size of the silicon chip for the large
                    sensors.
                    The
                    protoboards are the same size so they can be used for reference to get a feel for the relative size
                    of
                    the
                    sensors.
                    The first thing that was done with the sensors was solder extra wire to the wire contacts on the
                    board
                    that
                    were put
                    there by the lab technicians.</p>

                <p>The base resistance values of the sensors were then measured and a hairdryer was used to heat them
                    and
                    observe a
                    resistance change when they experienced a temperature change. This is shown in table <a

                        data-reference="tab:baseResistTable">1</a>.
                    Something interesting is that no matter
                    which sensor was tested, they all showed the same variation in resistance of <span
                        class="math inline">3<em>k</em><em>Î©</em></span>. This reading was done with the digital
                    multimeter
                    and

                    at
                    least 17.
                    There was a resistance change, so testing proceeded as planned.</p>

                <p>The Adafruit FLORA was the micro controller that was chosen for this project. It has 4 10-bit analog
                    to
                    digital
                    inputs which gave us 1024 values of sensor signal resolution. For initial testing, the FLORA was
                    attached to
                    the
                    computer and read values from one of its analog inputs. This reading was then printed to the serial
                    port
                    and
                    captured with CoolTerm, which would copy the serial port data and write it to a .txt file. The data
                    was
                    collected
                    and then was processed in MATLAB after collection had finished.</p>
                <p>The entire testing setup is shown in figure <a href="#fig:Testing Setup" data-reference-type="ref"
                        data-reference="fig:Testing Setup">4</a>. This is the home laboratory that was used. On the
                    right
                    side
                    of the
                    image shows the hairdryer used for applying heat to the sensors, below the hairdryer is the sensor
                    cluster
                    with the
                    sensor being tested which was resting on top of the calibration thermometer. This thermometer was a
                    cheap
                    outdoor
                    thermometer that was picked up from home hardware for less than $10. The reason this thermometer was
                    chosen
                    was
                    because the back of the thermometer has an opening that exposes the bulb. When testing each sensor,
                    the
                    bulb
                    of the
                    thermometer was as close to the sensor being tested as possible.</p>

                    for
                    a
                    calculated temperature range of 0 to 50. The initial circuit used to test the signal is shown in
                    figure

                    and
                    will be
                    discussed in a shortly. To the left of the circuit is the FLORA micro controller which took the
                    circuit
                    signal as
                    input and printed a 10 bit analog to digital signal to the serial port as output. As previously
                    mentioned,
                    the
                    serial port signal would then be processed.
                </p>
                <p>In order to read the small change in resistance as a signal, it needed to be amplified. This
                    amplification
                    was done
                    through a differential amplifier as seen in figure <a href="#fig:InitialCuircuit"
                        data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:InitialCuircuit">5</a>. The RTD thermal sensor was
                    connected in a voltage divider
                    setup with
                    a top resistor of approximately equal value to the resistor. This made the voltage across the RTD
                    half
                    of
                    the input
                    voltage and also maximized the swing of the voltage due to changes in resistance of the RTD. This
                    input
                    voltage was
                    sent though a buffer as to not impact the sensitive differential amplifier. A reference voltage also
                    needed
                    to be
                    created to use the differential amplifier most effectively. The reference voltage was created with a
                    <span class="math inline">50<em>k</em><em>Î©</em></span> potentiometer. For each sensor that was
                    being
                    testing,
                    the
                    potentiometer was adjusted such that the signal at room temperature gave the lowest stable reading
                    in
                    the
                    serial
                    output, which was approximately 100 out of the potential 1024 values from the 10 bit input. This
                    made
                    sure
                    that
                    there was plenty of room to increase the signal.

                <p>A gain factor of 162.5 would have been ideal. But the resistors that were available in the home lab
                    were
                    all
                    in a
                    plastic bag full of old, used resistors. Figure <a href="#fig:Testing Setup"

                    ice tray
                    to the left of the power supply. It would suffice to say that the required resistors were not easily
                    available, so
                    values were selected to give a gain as close as possible to the value calculated in equation

                    could begin.</p>
                <h2 id="evaluation-measurement-technique">Evaluation &amp; Measurement Technique</h2>
                <p>Each sensor was calibrated according to its own response to the calibration measurements. Although
                    there
                    was
                    only two
                    sources of constant temperature to use as calibration, the temperature response of the sensors
                    should
                    have
                    been
                    linear in nature so having two points would produce sensors with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
                    The
                    calibration
                    points was room temperature, which at the time of testing was approximately 12, and hair dryer
                    temperature
                    which
                    ranged from 30 to 33 depending on how long it had been previously running.</p>
                <p>Data collection happened over the course of 5 minutes and a histogram was collected to produce a mean
                    and
                    standard
                    deviation for precision and accuracy metrics. This was done for both calibration points and then the
                    calibration
                    values were hard coded into the Adafruit FLORA and temperature readings were taking of both the
                    wrist
                    and
                    the
                    underarm to get multiple readings on the body.</p>

                <p>The primary decision that needed to be made about this project early on was to decide on the
                    microcontroller
                    for the
                    readout and processing system. It was originally planned to create our own surface mount flexible
                    circuit
                    boards on
                    Kapton and then mount a stand alone microprocessor on it, but due too time constraints, we opted for
                    the
                    prefabricated FLORA board instead. The reason this board was chosen was because it was recommended
                    by
                    Nagui
                    Mikhail.
                </p>
                <p>CoolTerm is a piece of software that I found that copied the signal from a COM port and replicated it
                    and
                    gave the
                    option of storing the values into a .txt file. This capability was crucial because although the
                    Arduino
                    IDE
                    would
                    display values from the serial port, there was no way to access them. I had begun looking into
                    writing
                    my
                    own C++
                    code to accomplish this when i found CoolTerm in Roger Meierâs website<span class="citation"
                        data-cites="CoolTerm"></span>.</p>
                <p>The last piece of software necessary for this project was MATLAB. This was my first programming
                    language
                    that
                    I
                    actually enjoyed so I knew it well and could do a lot of numerical analysis. However my version was
                    out
                    of
                    date and
                    I didnât have access to the histogram function which came out in 2018. So it required an update.</p>
                <p>The digital multimeter was supplied by the school and was used with 10mV precision.</p>
                <p>The thermometer was just some cheap way of reading the atmospheric temperature near the sensor. I did
                    shop
                    around for
                    better thermometers however the more accurate thermometers with exposed bulbs were candy
                    thermometers
                    and
                    they have
                    a minimum temperature of 25.</p>
                <p>After these components, the other equipment was standard electrical equipment, power supple,
                    oscilloscope.

                <p>With regards to the FLORA, it was a rushed and uneducated choice. Even Adafruit themselves suggest
                    using
                    a
                    different
                    board called the "Gemma" for projects outside the scope of basic fashionable electronics. This board
                    basically
                    served as only an interface between the computer and the sensor, its programming memory is 32kB so
                    not
                    enough memory
                    for micropython. Putting any reasonably sized program on these devices would be a strain, especially
                    if
                    planning to
                    use dynamic memory allocation to store historical values form the sensors. Since this selection was
                    largely
                    my
                    responsibility I ended up learning a lot about microprocessors and would have selected a different
                    board
                    from
                    Arduino or Adafruit that uses the new rp2040 microprocessor as I thought getting experience with
                    this
                    piece
                    of
                    technology would have been more marketable after graduating.</p>
                <p>The input on the FLORA is assumed to be linear in the range of the 10 bit analog to digital input,
                    after
                    that
                    the
                    values are calibrated to reflect temperature values so as long as the input is linear then it will
                    be
                    accurate.</p>
                <p>The digital multimeter has an error of plus or minus 20mV as the precision it was used in was in the
                    10mV
                    range and
                    standard error is plus minus 2 of the last stable digit.</p>

                <p>Something to note about this data is that the large sensors appear to be less sensitive to changes in
                    ambient
                    temperature. That is to say that for a given temperature increase, the larger sensors produce less
                    of a
                    voltage
                    change. This may be caused by the larger silicon chip. In this scenario the silicon chip would act
                    as a
                    larger
                    thermal reservoir and absorb more thermal energy from the thermistor. This means that a sacrifice in
                    the
                    temporal
                    resolution would be the cost of the greater accuracy presumed to be a feature of the larger
                    thermistor.

                <p>Just like in the calibration table, the small and large sensors were separated and each individual
                    sensor
                    was
                    measured according to their calibration data. The Temperature and error(<span

                    can be seen for both the wrist and the body for all sensors. This data was then put together into a
                    plot
                    shown in
                    figure <a href="#fig:ResultsPlot" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ResultsPlot">19</a>

                    the
                    body as
                    measured by the calibration thermometer. The upper line (37) represents the temperature that Google
                    says
                    is
                    the
                    normal body temperature. The bottom axis in figure <a href="#fig:ResultsPlot"
                        data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ResultsPlot">19</a> only serves as an index axis
                    to separate each of the sensors
                    individually and into a group. The large sensors are shown in the left cluster and the small sensors
                    are
                    shown in
                    the right cluster. The height of each point indicates the relevant temperature reading.</p>
                <p>This plot shows that most of the sensors readings were clustered around where the calibration
                    thermometer
                    measured
                    the body temperature With that in consideration one could say that these sensors are true to their
                    calibration and
                    that there is a systemic error of approximately 15 in these sensors.</p>

                    they ended up. I will talk about the instructions on how to use the sensors and also address any
                    future
                    work
                    that
                    could be completed for this project.</p>
                <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
                <p>The project started off with the designing a thermal sensor using resources provided by the
                    professor.
                    The
                    sensor
                    design was then sent to Cameron who designed the mask in L-edit with the help from grad students.
                    The
                    mask
                    ended up
                    being delayed and the fabrication of the sensors was delayed. At the beginning of march the sensors
                    were
                    finalized
                    and delivered to us where I calibrated and then tested the sensors before sending the equipment over
                    to
                    Thomas who
                    when proceeded to test his sensors. The thermal sensors ended up being precise to within a half a
                    degree
                    but
                    there
                    was systemic error was large at 15.</p>
                <h2 id="design-implementation-and-practical-use">Design Implementation and Practical Use</h2>
                <p>The sensor requires a conditioning circuit so in order to mass manufacture this it will need to be
                    created
                    with a
                    task specific manufacturing device with the resistors planned out for operational amplifier. The
                    sensor
                    itself would
                    need to be manufactured on Kapton to be flexible and not succumb to the thermal sink the silicon
                    wafer.
                    I
                    also
                    believe that the sensor should be smaller even at the cost of accuracy. The temporal resolution and
                    physical
                    size of
                    the sensor are inappropriate for a bio-metric sensor</p>
                <h2 id="instructions-for-using-the-produced-design">Instructions for Using the Produced Design</h2>
                <p>One sensor at a time needs to be assembled in a circuit as seen in figure <a
                        href="#fig:ConditioningCircuit" data-reference-type="ref"
                        data-reference="fig:ConditioningCircuit">8</a> with the voltage divider
                    resistor of
                    approximately equal value. The circuit takes a voltage of 5V such that the Op-amps can produce the
                    3.3V
                    needed for
                    the maximum FLORA signal. The potentiometer should be adjusted such that the serial readout of the
                    FLORA
                    is
                    approximately 100 at 12. Then the calibration must be hard coded into the FLORAâs code. The serial
                    readout
                    will now
                    read the calibrated temperature for the specific sensor that is being used.</p>
                <h2 id="concluding-remarks-and-future-work">Concluding Remarks and Future Work</h2>
                <p>Over the course of this project I have thought about how it could be applied to my future career. I
                    am
                    disappointed
                    that I did not get to explore this topic with the help of professor Prakash more in depth as I think
                    that
                    sensor
                    design and implementation is a field in which I would like to work. COVID has undoubtedly effected
                    the
                    lives
                    of many
                    people all over the world, and even today it is still causing problems in the form of new and
                    dangerous
                    variants.
                    The time delays from this virus meant that I did not get to redesign the sensors at all. I also was
                    not
                    able
                    to
                    fabricate the sensors to Kapton or use our own surface mount components to create our own fully
                    wearable
                    flexible
                    sensor node that would transmit data to your phone. I believe this would have been possible if we
                    were
                    allowed to
                    work together at the school, Most of the group seemed motivated to get their work done on this
                    project.
                </p>
                <p>For future work, if I had more time, I would have like to preform a redesign of the thermal sensors
                    and
                    fabricated an
                    array of different sizes of sensors. I would have also made the gaps between the sensor wires larger
                    to
                    avoid any
                    kind of field effect resistive properties. These are the two parameters I would have tried to vary
                    in
                    the
                    second
                    redesign.</p>
                <p>I look forward to applying the lessons that I learned in this project to my future career.</p>
