                <h1>AI Learns To Play Snake</h1>
                <p>
                    This project is currently underway. keep track of its <a
                        href="https://github.com/BrendanArmstrong1/NeuralNet" target="_blank">progress</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Teaching a Deep neural network to learn how to play a game of snake is the goal of this project.
                    So far, I have coded an AI framework and have tested an epsilon greedy reinforcement learning
                    technique. This didn't work as well as I had hoped. The AI learned to avoid the walls and would
                    eat the fruit when it was within 3 squares. However most of the time the AI just went around in
                    circles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My next approach will be using the advantage actor critic method. This will require me to refactor
                    quite a lot of my code in order to achieve this so I am taking a small break to work on other
                    projects.
