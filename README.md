# Brendan's Website

## Purpose

This website is intended to be a personal portfolio/online presence that is separate from traditional sites like LinkedIn
and Indeed. I want to showcase projects and write a blog where I can express my thoughts on subjects like technology, economics, 
and perhaps even philosophy. I intend to make it palatable to potential employers though, so I will avoid avant garde subject
matter.

## Progress

So far I have a style that I like. Perhaps the color scheme could be improved to affect the viewers subconscious perception of
me? I will leave that for future development. At the moment, what I need to finish to make this publishable are:

- Correct html version of final year report to accurately portray content.
- Add apparopriate messaging in subsections that are empty.
