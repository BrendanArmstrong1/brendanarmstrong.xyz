                    <h2>Python</h2>

                    <p>
                        There is a common adage that states "If you want to code fast, use python. If you want fast
                        code,
                        use C". I find this to be an absolute truth. Python is an amazing scripting language and I enjoy
                        writing all
                        sorts of my own automation modules with it. From web scrapping to number crunching, python is an
                        incredible language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have experience with libraries like numpy for data analysis, matplotlib for creating beautiful
                        displays of formatted data, numba for parallelization, openCV for computer vision, as well as
                        pytorch
                        and tensorflow for artificial intelligence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To be clear, python is a language that I use to solve problems and automate my life.
                        I don't feel like I need to be exhaustive about all of the libraries that I know. I know enough
                        about
                        python to solve any problem with it.
                        The property that makes python so versatile is there community of people working on it, creating
                        all kinds of libraries for all purposes. In order to master python, one must also master google.
                    </p>

                    <h2>C</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a language that I am learning from the ground up. I have read K&amp;R ANSI C and enjoyed
                        writing my own system modules. I plan on making many projects in the future that involve system
                        automation. Currently my most extensive project in C is my activity log that can be found in my
                        github repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most important factor of learning C is that it changes the way the programmer thinks about
                        memory management. This change effects more than their programming style, it makes everything
                        they do become more efficient.
                    </p>

                    <h2> Matlab</h2>

                    <p>
                        My first programming experience that I can remember was with Matlab. I used it in university
                        and fell in love with it. Matlab is great for number manipulation and plotting data. I would
                        have
                        continued using Matlab if I was never introduced to python with the numpy library. I used Matlab
                        to
                        analyze the data from my fourth year project in sensor morphology. Matlab is an absolute
                        pleasure to use and I will always love how effective it is for data analysis.
                    </p>

                    <h2> Artificial Intelligence</h2>

                    <p>
                        As I mentioned in my intro paragraph at the top of this page, automation is my passion in life.
                        Automation has always been something that I have enjoyed but my discovery
                        and personal research into artificial intelligence(AI) has boosted my passion even further. I
                        remember first finding out about AI as deep neural networks. I was
                        amazed that a matrix of numbers was capable of making decisions or <em>"seeing"</em> images.

                        I ended up building my own framework for a fully connected "dense" layer and a parallelized
                        convolutional layer. This project expanded my skill set in python and is available in my Github.
                        Learn more about it in my Projects section.

                    <h2> Linux</h2>

                    <p>
                        After I finished my degree in May of 2021, I had reached a point where I no longer needed to use
                        windows for its document editing suite. I was starting to get more interested in coding
                        and I wanted to use vim as a terminal based text editor. Although this was possible,
                        windows does not make easy. So I decided to make the switch to Linux and I haven't looked back
                        since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I skipped the traditional starting point of Ubuntu and went straight into arch Linux.
                        The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide" target="_blank">ArchWiki</a>
                        is a fantastic resource for getting started with arch and this distribution has been an absolute
                        pleasure to install and use. Configuring arch did take a lot of learning and troubleshooting but
                        I am better able to appreciate my system as a result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was also when I was exposed to the traditional UNIX programs like
                        <a href="https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Grep.html" target="_blank">grep</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html" target="_blank">awk</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html" target="_blank">sed</a>, and all of
                        the rest. I learned how to script in bash and automate system functions. I enjoy making my
                        computer do the tedious work of scrapping though documents and modifying text.
                    </p>

                    <h2> HTML / CSS</h2>

                    <p>
                        This webpage was built from the ground up with html and css. There are easier ways of getting a
                        website made, and these ways also aren't as buggy as my homemade version. So, why did I choose
                        the
                        harder route? I don't want a job in web development. It's because I wanted to be invested
                        in this website that was supposed to represent who I am. One of my personal motto's when it
                        comes to programming and technical development is "don't worry, be hacky". This means that even
                        if a product doesn't function at maximum efficiency, the top priority is to make it work. After
                        that, you can then either improve it, or move on to different projects and learn new techniques
                        that could be applied when you return to previous projects. This is why I choose to make a
                        website from scratch, I wanted to learn html and css and even added asynchronous JavaScript
                        with my interactive AI module.
